Womb Keeper: Good, you're awake. You're lucky to be alive.
Womb Keeper: When you were left here, you had the signs of one unable to recover.
Womb Keeper: Yet I knew so little of how your kind is organized on the inside.
Womb Keeper: You'll have to forgive me if things are arranged quite differently than you remember.
Womb Keeper: Have no fear, you will continue on in this form, as have all my womb-children.
